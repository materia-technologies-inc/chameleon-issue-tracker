## Repository Protection

This repository uses the following protection mechanisms:

- **Branch Protection**: The `main` branch requires pull request reviews for all changes
- **CODEOWNERS**: Changes to `.github/` files require approval from repository maintainers
- **Rulesets**: Additional file-path-specific protections for template integrity

These protections ensure that issue templates remain consistent and reliable for all users.
